# DON'T WRITE LOOPS
# R is a vector based language, and so accessing individual elements can be slow.  It's often
# faster to operate on an entire vector at once instead of looping over all the elements.
# But, it's often harder to do this "vectorization" of your code.  So, don't worry about it
# unless your code is running too slowly or if you're working with big data.
# Google can be very helpful.
