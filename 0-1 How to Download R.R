# HOW TO DOWNLOAD R

# www.r-project.org

# click download R
# pick a mirror close to you
# click on the right link
# click on "install R for the first time"
# follow the instructions

# most (all?) school computers have R

## HOW TO GET NEW VERSIONS
# You can install multiple versions on the same machine, but the version you use
# probably doesn't matter too much.  If you use alot of packages, though, you'll
# want to make sure you update occasionally (probably once every 3-6 months or so).
# Current version is 3.1.1 (as of 08/15/2014)
